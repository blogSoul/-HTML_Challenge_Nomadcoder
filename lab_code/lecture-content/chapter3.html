      When selling whale Tokens, the seller first takes half of the cost of each sold token from the general <span>supply</span>. This money can immediately be used for other whales on the same or another ship.
 Next, in clockwise order from the seller, each other player can buy one of the sold tokens or pass. The other players take turns either buying or passing, until all of the sold tokens are bought, or all players pass. The selling player may not repurchase whales they have sold. A buyer pays the full cost of each token to the general supply, and adds the whale to their supply to be scored.
